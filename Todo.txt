Try setting 'merge' function in 'sorting_and_searching/merge_sort.c' to static to encapsulate it.

Remove 'merge' function from sorting_and_searching.h

Same as 1 and 2 above, but with find_smallest in selecton_sort.c

Same, but also 'quicksort_partition' in quick_sort.c.
Also try setting it to static within quick_sort.c

Sorting:
1) Randomize quicksort
2) Median-of-3 quicksort
3) Stop recursing for n < k, then run insertion sort on entire array

Create Makefile for sorting_and_searching.so shared object
Create Makefile for sorting_and_searching_mains.c, which presumably depends on the above, which depends on each individual object file.
