Refactor the recursive call to max-heapify within max-heapify into an iterative procedure, using a while loop and changing the parameters where the recursive call would be. Just like tail-recursive-quicksort refactor


Sorting:
1) Randomize quicksort
2) Median-of-3 quicksort
3) Stop recursing for n < k, then run insertion sort on entire array
