The bulk of the code here consists of shared libraries of various data structures and algorithms located in the 'C/datastructures_and_algorithms/' directory. The C directory also contains problems from K&R's "The C Programming Language", and the Cpp directory has the beginnings of implementations of data structures and algorithms in C++, and is the current working directory.

If anyone notices a way the code could be improved, I encourage you to let me know either through GitHub or by emailing me directly at stenagli@umich.edu.
